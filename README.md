Welcome to the Blockchain Hackathon!

Here are the key objectives for all participants:

After registering, you will be redirected to a page where you will see some details that you will need to do the hackathon.

The token is **Gohub Hack (GHH)**, it's in Ethereum Sepolia network, you can find all the information about the token and the contract in [sepolia.etherscan.io](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x8efa809bc27a9d25772b1c1ab69b87462d0312d8#code). Probably for next steps, you will need the contract address and the abi code.

### Send some Tokens to Depasify Wallet:
Using your desired coding language, send some of the tokens you received to the next Depasify wallet using native transfer technology. We recommend using Python or JavaScript, and web3 packages, but there are more available.

The depasify wallet is: **0x64bc5be8db527c53fdbfbb2a7f928f5dbeff4721**.

### Send the Transaction to Depasify Platform:
After completing the transaction to the Depasify wallet, send it to our platform using the API Link Blockchain Payment Depa. This way you can operate your digital assets with our platform.
