# Tech Unpacked #2: Fintech Goes Web3

Join us on May 9th for the second edition of Tech Unpacked, a series of events hosted by GoHub Ventures to explore cutting-edge technologies.

​This time, Web3 takes center stage! The session will be a hands-on exploration of how Web3 is changing the fintech sector, where we will discover the meaning of wallets, nodes, and how to make transfers.

​Attendees will explore integrating blockchain with Depasify APIs for real-world financial applications, like sending a payment from Spain to Colombia in 10 seconds 💸 or treating a friend to a beer straight from your wallet 🍺

​We'll wrap up the event with some casual networking, beers, and pizza on us!
